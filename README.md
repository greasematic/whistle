=======

Whistle is a framework that helps you write apps where business logic (core functionality) 
is separate from delivery mechanism (http / command line).

As an added benefit, persistence (saving to DB) is also separated from business logic. 
Your dependence on an ORM reduces drastically making it possible for you to move from 
relataional DB to non-reltation DB reasonably easy
